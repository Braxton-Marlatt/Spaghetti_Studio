   - Used for interactions such as picking up the ingredient.

3. **IngredientDisplay Script**:
   - Handles the visual representation and data binding of the ingredient.
   - Dynamically sets the sprite and updates the GameObject's name based on the ingredient data.
        - Matches the ingredient data's sprite key value to the name of the sprite in the Resources folder.

4. **Item Script**:
   - Stores metadata about the ingredient, such as its ID and sprite.
   - Facilitates interactions with the ingredient, such as collecting it during gameplay.
