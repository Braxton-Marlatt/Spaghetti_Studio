<H1>Question:</H1>
 
Walk me through your test plan. Give an example where a test case later found a bug in your code by things a teammate added later. (Or explain why you chose a test case specifically because you wanted to ensure that a teammate would know if they broke your code.)

<H1>Explanation:</H1>
<ul>

<li>I noticed that when Collin changed the way that health was called it messed with my already existing code. So I had to change to the my code and tests to use the new updateHealth functions. </li>

<li>I also had issues of getting the healing items to work and through testing I was able to see I was updating the health, but it was never getting called so I was able to fix that. </li> 
	  
<li>I also had a few other boundary tests where I would spawn lots of items until a maximum and I also would test whether or not I would be able to apply speed boosts past a certain point. </li>
<ul>
      <li>I noticed that I was unable to spawn items past the maximum</li>

      <li>I also noticed that my speed boost was not stopping at the maximum value and would keep increasing.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<H1>Test Plan:</H1>
<ul>

<li><a href="./CP_BoundaryTests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boundary Tests</a></li>
<li><a href="./CP_StressTest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stress Test</a></li>
